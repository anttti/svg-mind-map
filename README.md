# SVG "Mind Map"

I wanted to learn about SVG and how to programmatically manipulate it. Thus, this project was born. If you want to run it locally, it's the usual:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

Or you can check out the live demo at [svg-mind-map.vercel.app](http://svg-mind-map.vercel.app/).

My learning has once again been sponsored by the almighty [Spice Program](https://spiceprogram.org)!
